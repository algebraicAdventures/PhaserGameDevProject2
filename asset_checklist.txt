Fixes:
- white outline / alignment of the combined red bubble/green bubble order sprite
- Tape roll - high resolution (the one on Github currently is really small)

Missing assets:
- Background -- DONE
    * Low contrast
    * Coffee shop interior with customers
- Countertop -- IN PROGRESS
    * As wide as you want, as long as it tiles horizontally
    * Two heights for stuff to sit on:
        - higher one for the area to drop off the order to the customers
        - lower one where the machine/objects sit on
        - keep perspective flat
- Bag of coffee beans
- [ANIMATION] Coffee coming out of the machine
- Funnel on the coffee machine that accepts beans
    Specs: Should be on the right side of the machine

"Polish" assets that would help the narrative:
- Something to put on the coffeemaker to make it seem shiny and new on the title screen
    * e.g. a little sparkle animation
    * Fallback: I'm just going to put the happy face on it
- Something to put on the coffeemaker to make it seem worn down on the game over screen
    * e.g: rust, cracks
    * Fallback: I'm just going to put the sad face on it
